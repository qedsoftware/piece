QED PIECE booting manual
========================


0. How PIECE works
------------------
PIECE is a bootable USB pendrive. It contains a full operating system.


1. Booting on PC
----------------
- Plug PIECE in
- Enter your computer's BIOS. To enter BIOS press <F2>, <F12>, <ESC> or <DELETE>
  when the manufacturer's logo shows up, right after power-on.
  Look for text similar to "Press X to enter setup" on the screen
- For modern PCs ensure that Secure Boot option is disabled in bios
- For computers with USB3.0 ensure that XHCI setting is enabled.
  Sometimes called XHCI Pre-Boot Mode or XHCI Hand-off
- Find boot order settings and ensure that USB drive option is on top of the list
- Save and reboot
- Your computer should now boot PIECE correctly


2. Booting on Mac
-----------------
- Plug PIECE in
- Right after the booting chime press and hold the Option key
- Release the Option key when a list of boot options is shown
- Select the USB drive from the list and press enter
- Your computer should now boot PIECE correctly


3. Booting in VirtualBox
------------------------
- Plug PIECE-VM in (PIECE-VM is a different pendrive setup!)
- Install VirtualBox on your computer
- Enable virtualization options in the BIOS if necessary
- Open VirtualBox
- Select File -> Import Appliance
- Find the .ovf file located on the pendrive
- Open settings of the imported VM and increase Base Memory
- Start the VM
- Optionally, make the VM display full-screen
- You now have PIECE running in a VM

4. Troubleshooting
------------------
- Q: How to boot PIECE on a Chromebook
  A: Chromebooks do not support booting from USB. Use the VirtualBox method

- Q: I have an Nvidia GPU and I can only see a black screen/terminal login after boot
  A: After booting, when a countdown is shown in the upper left corer of the screen press <ESC>.
     This opens the GRUB menu. Navigate to the second option called "Ubuntu Nvidia GTX 8XX, 9XX workaround"
     and press enter.
